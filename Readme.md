## Documentation

This modules gives you an option to set your Orchard site into read-only mode. Read-only mode is useful if you want to temporarily content-freeze your site (only advised for a very short time).

When read-only no content item (except for site settings) can be saved as saving will fail with a validation error. The error message displayed is customizable.

You can edit settings from under site settings and also you can set the mode of the site from the command line with the readonly set/reset/toggle commands.

Read-only is part of the [Lombiq Hosting Suite](http://dotnest.com/knowledge-base/topics/lombiq-hosting-suite), a suite of modules making Orchard able to scale better, more fault-tolerant, and have improved maintainability.
